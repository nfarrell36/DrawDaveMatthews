# DrawDaveMatthews

At R.I.T., our Python coursework began with using the turtle library to draw shapes as we learned recursion. I went a bit overboard and ended up drawing a picture of my favorite artist, Dave Matthews, for our class's python art contest. I ended up winning.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Open up the project in your IDE of choice
3. Point your run configuration to the `main` method in the `drawDaveMatthews.py` file
4. Enjoy!
